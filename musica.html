        <p class="p1">I've wasted my nights<br/>
            You turned out the lights<br/>
            Now I'm paralyzed<br/>
            Still stuck in that time when we called it love<br/>
            But even the Sun sets in paradise
        </p>
        <p id="p4">I'm at a payphone trying to call home<br/>
            All of my change I spent on you<br/>
            Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong<br/>
            Where are the plans we made for two?</p>
        <p class="p5">If happy ever after did exist<br/>
            I would still be holding you like this<br/>
            All those fairy tales are full of shit<br/>
            One more fucking love song, I'll be sick<br/>
            Now I'm at a payphone</p>
